How the player plays:

    Each player successively selects two cards from the face-down cards on the table. 
    If the cards have the same symbol, the player earns the value of one of the cards, 
    the pair is removed from the table, and the next player takes their turn. 
    If the cards do not match, they are returned face-down to their original positions, 
    and the next player continues. If a player reveals two Jacks, they score and take another turn. 
    If they reveal two Kings, they score and the next player loses their turn. 
    If a player reveals a Queen and a King, they are allowed to flip one additional card.
    The game ends when all cards have been revealed 
    and the winner is the player who has collected the most points."

    How the computer plays:
    
    It keeps a history of the last five cards that have been revealed by either the player or 
    the program and follows the strategy below:

    1.If the history contains cards that match by symbol, it selects and reveals those cards, 
    removes them from the table and deletes them from the history.

    2.If there are no matching cards in the history, it reveals the first random card 
    from the face-down ones. If it finds a matching card in the history, 
    it selects it, wins the pair, and removes both cards from the table 
    and from the history. Otherwise, it selects a second random face-down card,
    and if the two cards do not match, it adds both to the history."
